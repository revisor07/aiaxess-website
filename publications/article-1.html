          <p id="ember1532" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">As a manager, you've struck gold in the
            labor market: a new recruit has just joined your division. This individual is not only quick and
            enthusiastic about work but also significantly contributes to the company's bottom line, provided he has
            ample access to necessary information. Despite these admirable traits, he exhibits the typical signs of
            inexperience. He's opinionated, always ready to lend a hand, but lacks the restraint to temper his words and
            actions. Occasionally, his unconventional views might even ruffle a few feathers. This is his first foray
            into the corporate world, a realm filled with compliance requirements he knows nothing about. Yet, his
            ability to sift through mountains of data, extracting and contextualizing relevant information—a task that
            would take days for even the most skilled personnel—is nothing short of remarkable. He can also devise a
            multi-step action plan for complex tasks and verify the results along the entire process, culminating in a
            flawless report or conclusion, showing a remarkable level of expertise for his inexperience that often
            surpasses expectations.</p>
          <p id="ember1533" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Your initial instinct might be to play
            it safe, to shy away from leveraging this exceptional talent, sticking to the time-tested methods that have
            served you for years. But whispers in the industry speak of a groundbreaking university program, one that
            shapes such raw, extraordinary talent into graduates of unparalleled capability. And your competitors, it
            seems, are already on board. This presents a conundrum: Can you harness the unique skills of this individual
            to bolster your division's performance, all while navigating the pitfalls of his corporate naivety? Is it
            possible to craft a synthetic employee who retains the essence of creativity and productivity but is also
            safeguarded against the risks his inexperience brings?</p>
          <p id="ember1534" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">This scenario isn't just hypothetical.
            The 'inexperienced employee' in question is, in fact, an AI system — the latest innovation from your AI
            vendor. It's designed to unearth hidden treasures within your corporate data silos, accelerating
            time-to-market and sharpening the competitive edge of your products. In this article, I will navigate you
            through various steps to harness this AI's potential effectively, ensuring you can unlock its value while
            mitigating any adverse consequences.</p>
          <h3 id="ember1535" class="ember-view">A naive implementation</h3>
          <p id="ember1536" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Why not completely outsource your search
            needs? The market is growing with SaaS solutions, sprouting rapidly like mushrooms after a rain in the Fall.
            These platforms promise that soon, every task involving information retrieval and analysis will be
            effortlessly managed by powerful cloud-hosted AI models. However, the recent upheaval at OpenAI has
            validated your initial reservations about relying on foundational models under external control. Opting for
            a more hands-on approach, you decide to experiment with a locally-deployed language model. This model,
            rooted in open-source for enhanced transparency and control, is tailored with augmented retrieval
            capabilities to tap into your corporate data repository. You select a vendor for this project. For
            continuity in our metaphor, let's name this AI 'Todd' and explore the challenges that emerge as you begin
            weaving this AI into the fabric of your technology and business processes. Our naive GenAI enterprise
            deployment might look like this:</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/article-1/post-new-kid-image-2.webp" alt=""></p>
          <h3 id="ember1538" class="ember-view">Adding access to corporate data stores</h3>
          <p id="ember1539" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">In its naive form, this rudimentary
            system offers limited value to the enterprise, primarily correcting grammar in marketing materials. While
            Todd is trained on various data and knowledge domains, he does not have the knowledge specific to your
            business. To elevate Todd's utility and enable him to respond to queries based on the corporate data, he
            must gain access to databases, APIs, and document repositories. Todd, with his remarkable creativity and
            near-flawless written language capabilities - he might even write software code - has a notable Achilles'
            heel: he is abysmally weak in mathematics, executing software code, and interacting with external systems
            such as databases and APIs.</p>
          <p id="ember1540" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">To compensate for these limitations,
            Todd needs support in navigating a complex corporate data landscape, as well as identifying relevant
            documents. Enter Berta and Agent Smith. Berta is an expert in mathematics, coding, and encoding, adept at
            transforming extensive text into lengthy numerical sequences known as 'embeddings.' Her expertise lies in
            utilizing these numbers, rather than words, for document comparisons and matching numerical representations
            of queries to the most relevant data. She brings a level of precision to information search that deftly
            handles its inherent uncertainties and ambiguities. Berta acts as the bridge between Todd's decisions to
            search for documents and the actual document repository, similar to an exemplary legal researcher skilled at
            uncovering relevant case precedents.</p>
          <p id="ember1541" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Embeddings are crucial for accessing
            unstructured data, which typically includes documents and files. However, unstructured data can also reside
            in NoSQL databases. Developers employ various methods to transform arbitrary text into embeddings, with BERT
            (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) being one of many open source and proprietary
            techniques. These advanced methods have the benefit of working with general text snippets. The document
            summaries, or embeddings, are usually stored in a vector database - a specialized database designed not just
            to store sequences of numbers but, more critically, to compute the 'distance' between any two such
            sequences. To understand the necessity for this type of database, consider a scenario involving geographical
            coordinates. Let's say Alice has known coordinates and seeks the nearest restaurant, each of which also has
            its coordinates. A simple search by longitude or latitude won't suffice; we need to calculate the actual
            distance using geometry, rank the restaurants accordingly, and then Alice can choose from the nearest ones
            after considering reviews:</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/article-1/post-new-kid-image-3.webp" alt=""></p>
          <p id="ember1543" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Now, imagine that instead of two
            coordinates, each point has thousands, and we can't search by any single coordinate but must use them all to
            calculate distances. Traditional SQL databases aren't cut out for this kind of search. This brings us to an
            important question: do you have the budget for a commercial vector database, or the resources to deploy,
            configure, and maintain an open-source alternative?</p>
          <p id="ember1544" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">The AI solution provider you've chosen
            may have implemented a trained document embedding model. However, there's no guarantee that it's been
            optimized for the specific types of documents your company handles. These documents might be
            semi-structured, with certain keywords or sections bearing more significance for search relevancy. Preparing
            this data to align with the AI's standard processing requirements could demand additional, sometimes
            substantial, time. For any augmented retrieval system to be effective, I recommend devising a series of test
            queries for the system, along with the 'ideal' responses it should generate. This allows you to
            quantitatively assess the accuracy of the system, categorizing results as perfect, acceptable, or
            unacceptable.</p>
          <p id="ember1545" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Agent Smith, in stark contrast to the
            more imaginative and creative Todd and Berta, is all about precision and efficiency. He specializes in
            executing highly specific tasks, seamlessly accessing corporate data stores, and running code and other
            commands with a methodical and deterministic approach. Todd, who is not equipped to directly interact with
            external applications, relies on Agent Smith to execute his commands. Whether Todd needs to delve into
            database information, or even initiate an API call to fetch data from a service, Agent Smith is his go-to
            executor. With Agent Smith's skill set, Todd, or his designated coding ally, can formulate API calls with
            precision, and construct SQL queries for direct database engagement. They can even create fully functional
            Python code snippets, similar to the capabilities seen in the latest chatGPT, designed for execution in a
            secure, sandboxed environment. These snippets are capable of performing complex mathematical calculations,
            much like humans employing calculators or Excel for basic arithmetic.</p>
          <p id="ember1546" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Tasked with diverse assignments, Agent
            Smith is akin to a multifaceted digital assistant. He meticulously executes Todd's commands, acting as a
            crucial link to the corporation's digital assets and even external resources through APIs and web services.
            Picture a team of Agent Smiths, reminiscent of the 'Matrix' movie, yet here they function as compliant
            workers executing individual tasks. These agents are not limited to information retrieval; they can act on
            specific instructions, paralleling how <a class="app-aware-link "

          <p>By adding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities with access to the corporate digital assets by
            'employing' Berta and a team of Agent Smiths (highlighted in green), you dramatically add the value your new
            employee, Todd, brings to your company:</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/article-1/post-new-kid-image-5.webp" alt=""></p>
          <h3 id="ember1550" class="ember-view">Adding security: Identity and Access Management</h3>
          <p id="ember1551" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Now that Todd, with Berta's assistance,
            has the capability to search and respond to queries using the accumulated knowledge in the corporate data
            stores, it's time to implement proper data governance controls. A critical question arises: Who is
            authorized to pose queries to Todd? Considering Todd's access to an extensive array of corporate
            information, it's plausible that some employees might attempt to exploit his naivety to access data they are
            not entitled to under corporate policies. To address this, you must integrate your newly hired talented team
            with enterprise IAM (Identity and Access Management) controls. This integration ensures that each query
            posed to Todd is cross-referenced with the user's data access rights, as already enforced at various data
            store levels - including documents, databases, data lakes, and APIs. Such a measure guarantees the
            preservation of data lineage through the AI 'black box', preventing the AI from morphing into a data
            equivalent of an 'opaque financial haven', often utilized in money laundering schemes to obfuscate money
            trails.</p>
          <p id="ember1552" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">However, controlling access to
            information is just one piece of the puzzle. You also need to establish a comprehensive data access trail
            for compliance and investigative purposes. This calls for the implementation of detailed activity journaling
            (logging). The log should capture a variety of information: the identity of the user, the timestamp of
            access, the network location of the request, the user's initial prompts, and the internal prompts generated
            by the AI incorporating the externally retrieved information. Additionally, the data store itself should
            maintain its own log, recording the identity of the querying user, the timestamp, the AI's request, and the
            information provided in response - either the content itself for brief data or a hash of the document for
            longer content. This meticulous logging process ensures that the final information relayed to the user is
            traceable, secure, and compliant.</p>
          <p id="ember1553" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Adding identity awareness to Todd makes
            it possible to store the conversation contexts for individual users, so that humans can see their
            interaction log with Todd, and for Todd to refresh his memory before answering a follow-up question (this
            “memory” is called “context window” in GenAI technical speak).</p>
          <h3 id="ember1554" class="ember-view">More security: User Behaviour Analytics</h3>
          <p id="ember1555" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">What happens if a user's identity and
            entitlements are authentic, but a malicious actor gains access to the AI through this valid identity, posing
            sensitive queries? Recall that Todd, our AI system, is programmed to dutifully respond to any question.
            However, Todd lacks the capability to remember each employee's interaction style or detect abrupt changes in
            their behavior. Is there a way to externally augment Todd with this user sensitivity?</p>
          <p id="ember1556" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Fortunately, the answer is yes, you can.
            You can enhance the AI-enabled infrastructure with a layer of detection using User Behaviour Analytics
            (UBA). For companies that transcended basic identity and access management and implemented advanced
            identity-centric intelligence - often referred to as IAI (Identity and Access Intelligence) - a UBA module
            is likely already in place. This module plays a pivotal role in identifying potential unauthorized access
            issues. UBA can be applied to both Todd's user interactions and Todd himself, monitoring for anomalies in
            access patterns. While changes in user behavior might be legitimate, such as a new task assignment or a
            shift in company role, they can also signal suspicious activities. A basic UBA system would track variations
            in the types of questions employees ask Todd and changes in the data output (both content and volume), with
            heightened alertness to Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This security layer might not outright
            prevent unauthorized access, but it will certainly enhance visibility into the AI system's operation. It
            also paves the way for the AI system to obtain future compliance certifications.</p>
          <p id="ember1557" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">By integrating Todd with identity and
            access management, prompt and conversation history logging, and user behavior analytics, you undoubtedly
            increase the deployment's complexity. However, this complexity is a small price to pay for a system that
            grows increasingly robust and secure:</p>
          <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/article-1/post-new-kid-image-6.webp" alt=""></p>
          <h3 id="ember1559" class="ember-view">Even more security: controlling for AI behavioral risks</h3>
          <p id="ember1560" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">While the current setup is functional,
            it can be further improved with robust risk management practices. Just as human performance can be
            influenced by external events and mood swings, as Todd's manager, you need to be cognizant of certain risks
            associated with him as an advanced AI. Todd's performance may fluctuate due to three key factors, each with
            its own set of risks and mitigation strategies: the inherently unpredictable nature of his output, the risk
            of a covert replacement by another entity, and the potential alteration of his 'personality' under 'negative
            influences'.</p>
          <p id="ember1561" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">The non-deterministic nature of language
            models is intrinsic to their technology. At any given point, the model selects the most probable next word
            from several options, each with varying likelihoods. This is why two consecutive runs of the model rarely
            produce identical responses, and in some cases, the model may even 'hallucinate'. It is hard to spot
            hallucination because the model confidently creates references, URLs, paper titles and authors that look
            legit, even when they are made up.</p>
          <p id="ember1562" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Occasionally, even a seemingly simple
            query can elicit unpredictable responses from the AI, particularly when the user's request is unfulfillable.
            <a class="app-aware-link "
              href="https://news.yahoo.com/a-silly-attack-made-chatgpt-reveal-real-phone-numbers-and-email-addresses-200546649.html"
              target="_self" rel="noopener" data-test-app-aware-link="">A recent incident of PII leakage from a
              model</a> underscores this critical vulnerability: GenAI systems may not know when to cease output
            generation or how to appropriately respond to novel requests. This incident also highlighted the risks
            associated with using PII in training datasets. Even in cases where the AI doesn't leak sensitive
            information, it can still generate unreliable or factually incorrect responses. For example, this summer, <a
              class="app-aware-link "
              href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-york-lawyers-sanctioned-using-fake-chatgpt-cases-legal-brief-2023-06-22/"
              target="_self" rel="noopener" data-test-app-aware-link="">two New York lawyers faced sanctions from a U.S.
              judge</a> for submitting a legal brief containing six fictitious cases, accidentally included as part of
            an AI-generated output.
          </p>
          <p id="ember1563" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">While data retrieval augmentation from
            corporate data stores with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture can't completely solve the
            issue of factual accuracy, it can guide the AI towards more reliable answers, backed by specific source
            references for verification. However, different queries may still yield slightly varied responses. This
            characteristic makes automated tests difficult, as the answers would require a human to correctly assess the
            quality of the response. For automated testing of the AI system, I recommend the approach similar to that
            used in standardized tests. This involves crafting prompts that pose multiple-choice questions to the AI,
            with answers that can be readily verified by a script, rather than requiring human intervention.</p>
          <p id="ember1564" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">The risk of Todd being suddenly replaced
            by a completely different AI entity is real. This could occur during a routine vendor update (where the
            model's weights are altered), or through a deliberate attack aimed at substituting the model with a
            compromised one. This rogue model might be engineered to react to specific keywords, disclosing sensitive
            information in a manner designed to evade privacy solutions. To mitigate this risk, robust IAM policies,
            signatures for the AI's binaries and weights (the latter being of highest importance), and regular automated
            performance tests are essential. Additionally, there's a reputational hazard if the model begins exhibiting
            biased, abusive, or offensive behavior. Could this lead to sexual harassment lawsuits against companies for
            the misconduct of their AI assistants?</p>
          <p id="ember1565" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">While control over the binary and
            primary weights is crucial, many AI architectures permit fine-tuning. A case in point is LoRA (Low-Rank
            Adaptation of Large Language Models). LoRA involves training a minor add-on to the core model without
            altering its main weights. This can be necessary for optimal performance with company-specific vocabulary or
            context, even helping the AI align with the prevailing corporate communication culture. Think of this add-on
            like a performance-enhancing substance (akin to coffee), subtly altering behavior, or as additional
            knowledge, reminiscent of Trinity downloading helicopter piloting skills in 'The Matrix'. These
            supplementary weights are critical and must be controlled. Despite being significantly smaller in size than
            the main weights, making them easier to download and replace undetected by standard network volumetric
            anomaly checks, their updates should be a meticulously controlled process with rigorous quality control
            checks. You don't want any bad influence on Todd, do you?</p>
          <p id="ember1566" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Another significant risk with generative
            AI (genAI) models is the inherent challenge in validating their internal content, as their weights represent
            an abstract, highly compressed version of the training data. The PII leaks by the model mentioned above
            underscore that personal data might have been part of the training set itself. Given the immense data
            requirements for training large models, it could be challenging for vendors to prove that PII or other
            sensitive information wasn't included in the training set. Although this issue can't be rectified within the
            model itself, it's possible to implement an additional layer of control to mitigate this risk, such as
            integrating a PII-specific model.</p>
          <h3 id="ember1567" class="ember-view">Have we mentioned security? Adding Andrew to the team to handle PII</h3>
          <p id="ember1568" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Even when a user is authorized to access
            certain information, there could still be configuration issues within the IAM system. Or, more concerning,
            the user's identity might have been compromised by a bad actor. Ideally, any accidental disclosure of PII in
            AI-generated responses should be intercepted before reaching the user. While existing solutions employ
            simple searches within unstructured answers for identifiers like addresses, SSNs, and names, PII can still
            slip through unnoticed. This is where your new team member, Andrew, steps in, with his sole focus being the
            detection of PII in questions and responses.</p>
          <p id="ember1569" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Andrew's personality is the opposite of
            Todd. While Todd is a fountain of creativity, skilled at integrating external data sources and boasting an
            English proficiency surpassing most humans, Andrew specializes in the meticulous task of PII detection.
            Unlike Todd, who excels at generating content, Andrew's strength lies in 'Named Entity Recognition' (NER) -
            a key capability of the first BART models and more recently, special-purpose LLMs. These models are not
            designed for text generation, but their proficiency in classifying elements within unstructured text, such
            as geographical locations, names, and SSNs, is unparalleled.</p>
          <p id="ember1570" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Andrew's role involves scrutinizing the
            responses generated by Todd to ensure no PII has inadvertently been included. If PII is detected, the
            system's response can vary. In some cases, accessing PII might require appropriate entitlements within the
            IAM, and Andrew, after verifying user privileges, would allow the response through, with the decision duly
            noted in the logs. A more complex system might require managerial approval for responses containing PII.
            Regardless of the method, our handling of PII will be thoroughly tracked and logged, fulfilling the
            requirements of privacy laws like CCPA and GDPR. You can specify what Andrew does when he discovers PII in
            the user questions or Todd's answers.</p>
          <p id="ember1571" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">With our final setup (again, new
            additions are highlighted in green), you've not only enveloped Todd in a cocoon of corporate controls but
            also assembled a team comprising Andrew, Berta, and several Agent Smiths. Together, they promise stellar
            performance at a reasonable cost. While real-world architectures may be more intricate, this governance
            framework offers a solid foundation for responsibly implementing AI. The future lies in an ecosystem of
            specialized and dedicated AI systems, seamlessly interacting with each other, corporate infrastructures, the
            external world, and human employees.</p>

          <h3 id="ember1573" class="ember-view">Conclusion</h3>
          <p id="ember1574" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">In an era where information about AI
            either gravitates towards technical advice or non-technical dystopian narratives, practical guidance for
            managers navigating the complex landscape of AI implementation in enterprises is scarce. This article aimed
            to bridge that gap by highlighting common risks associated with generative AI and providing a toolkit of
            questions for technical teams implementing AI in your business unit:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>What specific problems will this AI implementation solve, and how will its impact be quantitatively
              measured?</li>
            <li>Where will the model be hosted - within the corporate perimeter or externally? Is it based on an
              open-source foundational model, or is it proprietary?</li>
            <li>What are the hardware (or cloud infrastructure) and any hidden licensing requirements (like those for
              the vector database) for deployment? What personnel resources are needed for maintenance, and is there a
              training requirement for system users?</li>
            <li>What data formed the training set for the main model, and what was used for fine-tuning?</li>
            <li>How does the behavior of the fine-tuned model differ from the generic model?</li>
            <li>Does the implementation adhere to best practices such as IAM controls, immutable logging of access and
              interaction, and binary signatures?</li>
            <li>For retrieval-augmented models, are AIM entitlements consistently applied between the AI implementation
              and access to data stores?</li>
            <li>In the event of compromised credentials, what detection controls are in place to prevent unauthorized AI
              access?</li>
            <li>How is PII managed in the input and output of the model?</li>
            <li>Are performance tests in place for automatic, ongoing verification of model accuracy and the absence of
              bias or negative tendencies?</li>
            <li>What is the process for updating binaries and weights, including main and additional LoRA-like add-ons?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p id="ember1576" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">As we conclude our exploration, business
            leaders are now armed not only with helpful questions but also with a strategic vision. This vision
            emphasizes the transformation of an AI system like Todd from raw potential to a dynamic driver of corporate
            innovation and growth. With Berta's analytical expertise, Andrew's focus on safeguarding sensitive data, and
            the Agent Smiths' precise task execution, Todd's capabilities evolve from mere potential to a tangible asset
            for your organization. Engaging with AI vendors and IT departments now becomes an essential step in
            unlocking these latent opportunities. As leaders in this technological advancement, our role is to guide
            this process with a focus on maximizing AI's capabilities and impact. We aim to enter this new era of
            innovation with a clear directive: to ensure that our technological advancements not only contribute to
            corporate growth but also resonate with the fundamental values at the core of our businesses.</p>
